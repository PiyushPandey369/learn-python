Python Mini Projects Collection

Welcome to my Python Mini Projects repository! This collection demonstrates proficiency in object-oriented programming (OOP), magic methods, and practical problem solving using Python. These projects highlight clean code practices, encapsulation, and interactive user experiences.

ATM Simulator

Description:
A menu-driven ATM simulation using Python classes.
It allows users to:

Create a secure PIN

Deposit and withdraw cash

Check account balance

Features:

Unique serial numbers for each ATM instance

Encapsulation: private PIN and balance

Menu-driven user interface for ease of use

Input validation for PIN and transactions

Coordinate Geometry Tool

Description:
A Python class to represent points in a 2D plane and calculate:

Slope between two points

Distance between two points

Equation of the line connecting two points

Features:

Object-oriented design

Handles vertical lines (slope is indeterminate)

Calculates Euclidean distance

Outputs line equation in standard form

Fraction Class with Magic Methods

Description:
A Fraction class demonstrating operator overloading using Python magic methods (__add__, __sub__, __mul__, __truediv__).
It supports arithmetic operations on fractions directly using +, -, *, and /.

Features:

Overloaded operators for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division

String representation (__str__) for clean output

Can be extended to support fraction simplification

Skills Demonstrated

Python OOP: Classes, private variables, static methods, magic methods

Problem Solving: Real-life ATM simulation, coordinate geometry calculations, fraction arithmetic

User Interaction: Menu-driven interface for ATM project

Clean Code Practices: Encapsulation, readable naming conventions, modular design
