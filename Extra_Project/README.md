<h2>Python Mini Projects Collection</h2>

Welcome to my Python Mini Projects repository! This collection demonstrates proficiency in object-oriented programming (OOP), magic methods, and practical problem solving using Python. These projects highlight clean code practices, encapsulation, and interactive user experiences.

<h3>ATM Simulator</h3>

<h4>Description:</h4>
A menu-driven ATM simulation using Python classes.
It allows users to:

-Create a secure PIN
-Deposit and withdraw cash
-Check account balance

<h4>Features:</h4>

-Unique serial numbers for each ATM instance
-Encapsulation: private PIN and balance
-Menu-driven user interface for ease of use
-Input validation for PIN and transactions

<h3>Coordinate Geometry Tool</h3>

<h4>Description</h4>:
A Python class to represent points in a 2D plane and calculate:

-Slope between two points
-Distance between two points
-Equation of the line connecting two points

<h4>Features</h4>:

-Object-oriented design
-Handles vertical lines (slope is indeterminate)
-Calculates Euclidean distance

->Outputs line equation in standard form

<h3>Fraction Class with Magic Methods</h3>

<h4>Description</h4>:
A Fraction class demonstrating operator overloading using Python magic methods (__add__, __sub__, __mul__, __truediv__).
It supports arithmetic operations on fractions directly using +, -, *, and /.

<h4>Features</h4>:

-Overloaded operators for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
-String representation (__str__) for clean output
-Can be extended to support fraction simplification

Skills Demonstrated

Python OOP: Classes, private variables, static methods, magic methods

Problem Solving: Real-life ATM simulation, coordinate geometry calculations, fraction arithmetic

User Interaction: Menu-driven interface for ATM project

Clean Code Practices: Encapsulation, readable naming conventions, modular design
