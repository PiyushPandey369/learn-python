Under the silver glow of the moon, Arjuna stands with Gāṇḍīva drawn, his breath a quiet promise before the storm.
Strength flows beneath warrior’s silk, his eyes blazing like dawn over Kurukshetra. Every movement is poetry—an arrow nocked, a heartbeat suspended, a world in waiting.
Call him Pārtha, Dhananjaya, Savyasāchī; tonight he is the arrow of desire—unyielding, precise, devastatingly radiant. A legend not merely witnessed, but one to whom you willingly surrender.
