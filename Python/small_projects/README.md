# Small_projects

This folder contains a collection of small Python projects demonstrating practical applications of programming concepts, problem-solving skills, and GUI development. These projects are designed to showcase creativity, logic, and hands-on Python experience.

## Programs

- `Cafe_prg.py` – A simple cafe billing system to practice menu handling and calculations.  
- `day_finder_gui.py` – A GUI application to find the day of the week for a given date.  
- `Day_Finder_logic.py` – Backend logic for the day finder application.  
- `fake_news_headlines.py` – A program to generate or detect fake news headlines.  
- `Guess_Number.py` – Interactive number guessing game demonstrating loops and conditions.  
- `internet_speedtester.py` – Check internet speed using Python libraries.  
- `introTkinter.py` – Basic Tkinter GUI exercises to understand interface creation.  
- `Mission_20.py` – A mini project with custom logic challenges.  
- `password_guessing.py` – Program demonstrating string manipulation and loops through password guessing logic.  
- `Scissor_Paper_Rock.py` – Classic game simulation with Python logic.  
- `typing_speed.py` – Application to test typing speed and accuracy.

## Skills Demonstrated

- Python programming fundamentals: loops, conditions, functions  
- File handling, string manipulation, and algorithmic problem solving  
- GUI development with Tkinter  
- Working with external libraries and APIs  
- Project design and modular coding  
- Creative and interactive application development

## Why This Folder Stands Out

These small projects are designed to be **practical, interactive, and visually demonstrative**. Each program shows an understanding of core Python concepts, logical problem solving, and the ability to build user-facing applications. Ideal for showcasing to recruiters as examples of coding skills, project organization, and application development experience.
