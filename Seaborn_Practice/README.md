- Count plots (countplot())

- Box plots (boxplot())

- Violin plots (violinplot())

- Swarm plots (swarmplot())

#### D. Regression Plots
- regplot() - Regression analysis visualization

#### E. Matrix Plots
- Heatmaps (heatmap())

- Cluster maps (clustermap())

#### F. Multiplots
- Joint plots (jointplot())

- Pair plots (pairplot())

## 6. Practical Examples
1) Working with the Titanic dataset

2) Working with the Tips dataset

3) Customizing plots with themes and palettes

4) Real-world data visualization examples

## Libraries Used
- Seaborn - Primary visualization library

- Matplotlib - Base plotting library

- Pandas - Data manipulation and analysis

- NumPy - Numerical computing


## Key Features Demonstrated
1) Easy dataset loading with built-in datasets

2) Attractive statistical graphics with minimal code

3) Complex plot types with single function calls

4) Customizable themes and color palettes

5) Integration with Pandas DataFrames

## Learning Outcomes
After completing this notebook, you will be able to:

- Create various types of statistical visualizations

- Customize plot aesthetics and themes

- Work with different types of data distributions

- Generate publication-quality plots

- Understand when to use different plot types for different data scenarios

**This notebook serves as an excellent starting point for data visualization with Seaborn and provides practical examples that can be applied to real-world data analysis projects.**
