# 📊 Pandas Series — Complete Learning Guide

This folder provides a **comprehensive and beginner-friendly introduction** to **Pandas Series** — one of the most fundamental data structures in the Pandas library.  
It covers everything from **creating a Series** to **performing mathematical operations**, **indexing**, **handling missing data**, and **working with real-world CSV data**.

## 📁 Folder Structure

| File Name | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **example.py** | A simple introduction to Pandas Series — what it is, how it works, and why it's useful. |
| **series_from_lists.py** | Demonstrates how to create Series from Python lists and dictionaries. |
| **series_Attributes.py** | Explains important Series attributes like `index`, `values`, `dtype`, and `shape`. |
| **series_using_read_csv.py** | Shows how to read Series data directly from a CSV file using `pd.read_csv()`. |
| **series_Methods.py** | Covers common Series methods such as `head()`, `tail()`, `sample()`, `value_counts()`, `sort_values()`, and `sort_index()`. |
| **series_maths_method.py** | Performs mathematical operations on Series such as `count()`, `sum()`, `mean()`, `median()`, `mode()`, `std()`, and `var()`. |
| **series_indexing.py** | Demonstrates indexing and slicing in Series — label-based, positional, fancy indexing, and editing values. |
| **series_python_functionalities.py** | Integrates Python’s built-in functionalities (`len()`, `type()`, `dir()`, `sorted()`, etc.) with Pandas Series. |
| **Arithmetic_Operator.py** | Explains how to apply arithmetic operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) on Series objects. |
| **Important_Series_Method.py** | Highlights additional and commonly used Series methods for data manipulation. |
